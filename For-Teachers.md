# For Teachers

## I. Purpose and Scope
*This aims to be a first introduction to computer programming, before all programming languages, including HTML.*

## II. Teaching Points
- "The Take" at the end of each lesson contains main teaching points for that lesson
  - These are useful in testing, assigning homework, and developing curricula

## III. Style
- Headings use two different types of capitalization
  - **Sentence capitalization** to list information or if following "sentence grammar"
  - **Title capitalization** if following title grammar
- Notes & comments don't end in periods so as to avoid confusion with code

## IV. Nature of Content
- 101 through 301 are focused on retaining teaching content
  - These need quizzes and comprehension tests
- 401 has some review, elaboration, and application
  - These need creative projects and chart/list memorization tests
- Teaching is designed to be *by non-didactic demonstration first* with explanation later
  - Use as few words as possible while demonstrating, mostly phrases like:
    - "Notice this..."
    - "Pay attention to what happens here."
    - "Keep watching."
    - "What's the difference?"
  - Mr. Bean and the Muppets' Swedish Chef would make the best instructors

## V. Syllabus
### *A. Course sections & lessons*
- "Lessons" are divided by topic, not by the amount of time needed to complete
- Lessons vary in length
- Length of a lesson is based on the amount of demonstration needed to understand the concepts, not the work by the student

### *B. How long the course takes to complete*
- Time span per academic level (Units 101-401, Unit 501, Unit 601)
  - K–5: Two academic years
  - Jr–Sr high school: One academic year
  - College: Three credit hours
- Managing time can be handled in any combination of two approaches:
  1. Shorter lessons could have time extended via more discussion, assignments, and testing
  2. Longer lessons could span longer amounts of time for teaching, keeping student workload low
- In 6-12, one 12-lesson course per 16-week quarter allows 4 extra weeks
  - To extend long lessons
  - To review and test

### *C. Graded student workload*
- Each academic level should have testing and assignments with appropriate levels of difficulty for both age and pace
- At any academic level, good homework would be to "find the command number that matches content listed in *The Take*"
- 601: *The Chalk*
  - Knowledge-based tests
  - Generate practical commands as might be seen in *The Keys*
- In K-5, the 6-12 pace could simply be halved
- In college and university
  - Students should review lessons on their own
  - Professors should highlight tested and assigned content and hold in-class demo Q&A
  - Assignments should be long-term projects to solve larger problems
  - Testing should be more comprehensive and theory-centered
- Managing academic term time allotment can be handled in any combination of two approaches:
  1. Shorter lessons could have time extended via more discussion, assignments, and testing
  2. Longer lessons could span longer amounts of time for teaching, keeping student workload low
- In 6-12, one 12-lesson course per 16-week quarter allows 4 extra weeks
  - To extend long lessons
  - To review and test
