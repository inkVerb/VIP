## The Chalk
### User Prompts: **#** or **$** in CLI Instructions
- In many Linux instructions, including these lessons, a hash (**#**) symbol precedes many commands, either on the preceding line or the same line
- **#** indicates that a command must be run as `root`
  - Either use `su` to login as the `root` user and work at a `root` **#** prompt
  - Or use `sudo` in front of each command
- **$** indicates that a command must be run as a normal user
  - This is why a dollar sign (**$**) preceded terminal commands in *Linux 101-501* units
- If unspecified, it might not matter using as `root` or a normal user
  - It can be important to run as a normal user for compiling programs such as with `make`; *always compile as a normal user, never `root`*
  - While we don't compile in this *Linux 601* unit, a SysAdmin must bear in mind that **$** (user) vs **#** (`root`) prompts matter
- These lessons don't add `sudo` to all commands run as `root` because you may or may not already be logged in as `root` depending on your situation
  - Generally, working from a **#** `root` prompt is considered "bad", but not necessarily alwaysâ€”especially not for SysAdmins
- Not all commands make this specification (in these lessons or in other Linux instruction sites), so be aware that you may need to run some commands as `root` even when there is no `sudo` or preceding hash (**#**) in the line commands you see

### *The Chalk* Instructions Precede Commands
- In units *101-501*, lessons began with commands, then ended with *The Take*
  - The *Linux 601* unit will not follow this format
- SysAdmin lessons are primarily conceptual and secondarily practice
- These conceptual lessons will begin with *The Chalk*, then commands may or may not follow in a *The Type* section
  - *The Type* commands are intended to be manually typed into the terminal as practice for real world or examination of SysAdmin work
    - These commands are intended to be examples only
    - You should be able to type varied versions of these from memory

# The Take

- Your machine is up to speed with the necessary packages installed

## Presume to Know:
- `find` - [101 Lesson 9: find](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip/blob/master/101/Lesson-09.md)
  - `find . -iname '*henry*'` - find all files containing "henry", ignore case
    - `-name` - case-sensitive
    - `-type d`, `-type f` only file or directory
- `grep` - [101 Lesson 10: grep](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip/blob/master/101/Lesson-10.md)
  - `grep "find me" *`
  - `some command | grep "find me"`
- Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) [201 Lesson 12: grep](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip/blob/master/201/Lesson-12.md)
