# Linux 101
## Lesson 9: find

Ready the CLI

```console
cd ~/School/VIP/101
```

___

| **1** :$

```console
mkdir abc abc-dir
```

| **2** :$

```console
ls
```

*Search for files by **file name** with `find`*

| **3** :$

```console
find "abc*"
```

*Note the error message*

| **4** :$

```console
find "/bin"
```

*Note it can find an **absolute path**, which starts with `/`*

*Specify to **search** somewhere; we'll search "here" (`.` = here)*

| **5** :$

```console
find . "abc"
```

*Note it found everything, it needs: `-name`*

| **6** :$

```console
find . -name "abc"
```

| **7** :$

```console
find . -name "abc*"
```

*...for "**Directories**": `-type d`*

| **8** :$

```console
find . -type d -name "abc*"
```

*...for "Files": `-type f`*

| **9** :$

```console
find . -type f -name "abc*"
```

| **10** :$

```console
touch abcsed.Setting
```

*Create some empty files with **file extensions** in their file names*

*(File extensions usually indicate a **file type**, so you will see them often)*

*(`-type` is not for 'file type', but for '`find` type')*

| **11** :$

```console
touch ink.png ink.PNG ink.jpg ink.JPG
```

*Create some directories with the same names as some of the file extensions we just made*

| **12** :$

```console
mkdir png PNG jpg JPG
```

| **13** :$

```console
find . -name "png"
```

| **14** :$

```console
find . -name "*.png"
```

| **15** :$

```console
find . -name "*png"
```

*Note `find` is **case-sensitive**, **ignore case** with: `-iname`*

| **16** :$

```console
find . -iname "*png"
```

| **17** :$

```console
find . -iname "*jpg"
```

| **18** :$

```console
find . -type f -iname "*png"
```

| **19** :$

```console
find . -type d -iname "*png"
```

# Glossary
- **absolute path** - a file and it's full location, starting with the directory tree from root
  - Starts with `/` and includes many directories
  - eg: `/absolute/path/directory/file` or `/home/john/abcsed`
  - We never used an absolute path until now, but it comes up later
- **case-sensitive** - whether UPPERCASE or lowercase matters
- **directory** - a single place that holds files or other directories
- **directory tree** - the list of directories inside directories to show a file location
- **file name** - the name of a file, including the file extension
- **file extension** - part of the file name, but comes after `.` period, usually to indicate the file type; can be anything
  - iÂ·e: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.mp3`, `.txt`, `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.conf`, `.php`, `.html`, etc
- **file type** - the type of file
  - ie: picture, audio, text, document, PDF file, config, PHP file, HTML file, etc
- **ignore case** - treat UPPERCASE and lowercase as the same
- **path** - a file's name after the directories the file is in
  - eg: `directory/somewhere/file`
- **search** - look for text in file names or file contents

# The Take
- `find` searches for files
- `find` needs two arguments in order to work:
  - Location
  - `-name what-to-search-for`
  - Order: `find /path/to/search -name what-to-search-for`
- `*` is a "wildcard" for text
- `.` is considered text to search for, not "concatenate" as in some languages
  - `file.*` can return with "file.jpg", "file.png", and "file." (must contain a period)
  - `file*` can return with "file.jpg", "file.png", and "files.jpg" and "files" (even with no period)
  - `*.png` is a normal way to search for all PNG files
- ".png", ".jpg", ".pdf", ".doc", etc are called "(file) extensions"
- `find` is normally case-sensitive, unless using the `-iname` flag
- It may be best to name files with lowercase extensions because of how `find` works
- `find` uses `-type` flags to narrow results
  - `-type d` (directories only)
  - `-type f` (files only)
