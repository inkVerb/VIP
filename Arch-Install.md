# Manjaro

## Create a Linux Live USB

1. Find the `/dev/...` name of your USB

| **1** :$ `lsblk`

2. Write the .iso file to your USB (your USB will be erased!)

| **2** :$ `sudo dd bs=4M if=manjaro-gnome-20.X.X-XXXXXX-linuxXX.iso of=/dev/sdf conv=fdatasync status=progress`

*This example assumes:*

  - *`/dev/sdf` is the device name for the USB*
  - *The .iso filename is in the present working directory as:* "**manjaro-gnome-20.X.X-XXXXXX-linuxXX.iso**"
