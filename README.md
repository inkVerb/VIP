## Learn Command Line Linux and Code

Whether you want to become a computer genuis or if you're a "computer dummy" and want to make computers less scary, start with Linux. Start simple. Start right here.

## Why learn Linux first?
*...Love for renaissance. Learn the roots first, everything else makes more sense...*

### 1. Universal: web server, desktop, Android — All open source! All the same language!
Linux is the most-used webserver operating system in the world, with no near rivals. It's desktop market share grows every year!
Linux is free and secure, for web servers, desktops, and Android. The Linux language is the same everywhere.
Learn all devices; learn what is secure; learn what is free; learn only once!

### 2. Ultra Simple — Better preparation to learn other languages!
The Linux "Shell/BASH" language is simpler than other languages, but shares many universal concepts of code.
Learn computer code concepts the easy, simple way, using a simple, universal platform language.
By learning one "byte" at a time, you don't have to learn a difficult concept while learning a more complex coding language at the same time.

### 3. Ultimate Knowledge, Ultimate Control — PHP, Python, Pearl, Node.js, HTML, CSS... sit atop Linux
It's one thing to learn a web app or server programming language; it's awesome to know the language under the language so you can *control the machine it runs on.*
PHP will make more sense if you have seen what this does: `sudo apt install php`
Once you know how to work with a computer terminal (Linux language), all code will be less scary because you'll know where code lives!

## Who should take this course?
- Everyone ages 7 through high school, as a general education course, home schooled or in the classroom
- Any college student majoring in computer code, the sooner the better, but anytime will do
- Anyone ages 13 or older interested in self-teaching to learn computers
- Any entrepreneur, project manager, copywriter, marketer, graphic designer, teacher, professor, life guard, dog catcher, firefighter, chef, union-card-carrying thespian, secretary, supervisor, executive, board member, politician, bureaucrat, dictator, monarch, Amway IBO, or the like who WILL NOT learn computer code, but wants a peaceful and powerful relationship with a marketing firm, software writer, and/or IT

## Install the apps used in this course

`sudo apt install gedit tilda nautilus chromium-browser firefox`

## First day of school

*Many lessons begin with commands or links you may need, but not necessarily, like this:*

`cd ~/School/VIP/shell/101`

___

*There are twelve lessons per level, sometimes they are divided into sections with Roman numerals*

*Lessons are separated by **TOPIC**, NOT **TIME**, so some may be longer than others*

*Each lesson has a "homework" comparison folder that can be checked at* [inkVerb/VIP Homework](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip-homework/)

*There is a free video series that explains these lessons at the* [inkVerb YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCILld59lH8VOsT9gfyAb77g)

Udemy! *You can get more teaching tips, take quizzes, work with a community, and earn credits in the Udemy course "VIP Linux"*

*You might learn some things merely by watching the videos, but you learn much more if you have Linux installed on your computer and participate*

*It is also very helpful if you know how to type correctly!* [write.pink/88](http://write.pink/88)

That is the end of these instructions. You should feel like a better person.

## Installing Linux & Vrk
*Optional free tools: If you want your own Linux PC super media workstation...*
1. Install Ubuntu (alongside Windows, if you want) via [these fast instructions on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9NvmAitlwA&list=PLizgE6nGB1Kx8jIY1JE2v9rcL9G9s_UDj)
2. Install Vrk via the commands at [verb.ink](http://verb.ink)
3. Type with correct fingers. Learn here: [write.pink/88](http://write.pink/88)

## About Linux
The Linux command line only requires a bootable Linux USB, such as [Ubuntu via unetbootin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYfEs0lQA8Y&index=4&list=PLizgE6nGB1Kx8jIY1JE2v9rcL9G9s_UDj). It's the best place to begin to understand computer code—basic commands, if-then tests, variables, arrays, functions, and more. Learn it simple in Linux first.
