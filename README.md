## Why learn Linux?
*Renaissance: Learn your roots first, then everything else makes more sense.*

### 1. Universal: Linux web server, Linux desktop, Android, macOS, iOS — All the same language!
- Linux is the most-used webserver operating system in the world, with no near rivals. It's desktop market share grows every year!
- Linux is free and secure, for web servers, desktops, and Android. The Linux language is the same everywhere.
- macOS and iOS use Unix, the same language Linux was based on.
- Learn all devices; learn what is secure; learn what is free; learn only once!

### 2. Ultra Simple — Better preparation to learn other languages!
- The Linux "Shell/BASH" language is simpler than other languages, but shares many universal concepts of code.

### 3. Ultimate Knowledge, Ultimate Control — PHP, Python, Pearl, Node.js, HTML, CSS... all sit atop Linux
- It's one thing to learn a web app or server programming language; it's awesome to know the language under the language so you can *control the machine it runs on.*
- PHP will make more sense if you have seen what this does: `sudo apt install php`
- Once you know how to work with a computer terminal (Linux/Unix language), all code will be less scary because you'll know where code lives!

## Who should take this course?
- Everyone ages 7 through high school, as a general education course, home schooled or in the classroom
- Any college student or graduate majoring in computer code
- Anyone ages 13 or older interested in self-teaching to learn computers
- Any entrepreneur, project manager, copywriter, marketer, graphic designer, teacher, professor, life guard, dog catcher, firefighter, chef, union-card-carrying thespian, secretary, supervisor, executive, board member, politician, bureaucrat, dictator, monarch, Amway IBO, or anyone who WILL NOT learn computer code, but wants a peaceful and powerful relationship with a marketing firm, software writer, and/or IT

## First day of school

*Many lessons begin with helpful commands or links, like this:*

Ready the CLI

```console
cd ~/School/VIP/101
```

___

*There are twelve lessons per level, sometimes they are divided into sections with Roman numerals*

*Lessons are separated by **TOPIC**, NOT **TIME NEEDED TO COMPLETE**, so some may be longer than others*

*At the end of each lesson is a section called* **The Take** *which lists learning objectives for that lesson; this is useful information for students, teachers, crafting exams, or developing a curriculum core*

*There is a free video series that explains these lessons at the* [inkVerb YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCILld59lH8VOsT9gfyAb77g)

Udemy! *You can get more teaching tips, take quizzes, work with a community, and earn credits in the Udemy course "VIP Linux"* (NOT READY)

*You might learn some things merely by watching the videos, but you learn much more if you have Linux installed on your computer and follow as you learn*

*It is also very helpful if you know how to type correctly!* [write.pink/88](http://write.pink/88)

That is the end of these instructions. You should feel like a better person.
