## Learn Command Line Linux and Code

Whether you want to become a computer genuis or if you're a "computer dummy" and want to make computers less scary, start with Linux. Start simple. Start right here.

### Why learn Linux first?
*...Love for renaissance. Learn the roots first, everything else makes more sense...*

### 1. Universal: web server, desktop, Android — All open source! All the same language!
Linux is the most-used webserver operating system in the world, with no near rivals. It's desktop market share grows every year!

Linux is free and secure, for web servers, desktops, and Android. The Linux language is the same everywhere; learn all devices; learn only once!

### 2. Ultra Simple — Better preparation to learn other languages!
The Linux "Shell/BASH" language is simpler than other languages, but shares many universal concepts of code.

Learn computer code concepts the easy, simple way, using a simple, universal platform language.

By learning one "byte" at a time, you don't have to learn a difficult concept while learning a more complex coding language at the same time.

### 3. Ultimate Knowledge, Ultimate Control — PHP, Python, Pearl, Node.js, HTML, CSS... sit atop Linux
It's one thing to learn a web app or server programming language; it's awesome to know the language under the language so you can control the machine it runs on.

PHP will make more sense if you have seen what this does: `sudo apt install php`

Once you know how to work with a computer terminal (Linux language), all code will be less scary because you'll know where code lives!

## Shell Crash Course

# [Shell 101](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip/tree/master/101-shell)

# [Shell 201](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip/tree/master/201-shell)

# [Shell 301](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip/tree/master/301-shell)

## Install the apps used in this course

`sudo apt install gedit guake nautilus chromium-browser firefox`

## First, a Quick Orientation

*This is italics, giving you instructions or explanation*

*Instructions never end with a period since it could be confusing in code*

*Sometimes instructions end with an exclamation mark! Could they end with a question mark?*

*Here is monospace code style:* `cp /alldirs ./bookkeeping/`

*In monospace, every character is the same width, it is meant to indicate a coding language*

*This is because both terminals and text editors use monospace fonts, being easier to use*

*Only and always enter monospace into the terminal if it is:*
1. Normal size, not a header size
2. Begins the line, not later in the line like this `cd .trash`

*Note that you would normally enter this* `cd` *command on the next line into the terminal...*

`cd ~/`

*Below is a block of code, merely for your reference; do NOT enter it in the terminal:*

```sh
# This is a comment in the code

echo "I am actually a real command."

exit 0

# That is all there is to this block of code

```

*There are twelve lessons per level, sometimes they are divided into sections with Roman numerals*

*Each lesson begins with commands you may need, but not necessarily, like this:*

`cd ~/School/VIP/shell/101`

`gedit &`

`nautilus . &`

___

*Each lesson has a "homework" comparison folder that can be checked at* [VIP Homework](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip-homework/)

*There is a free video series that explains these lessons at the* [inkVerb YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCILld59lH8VOsT9gfyAb77g)

*You can get more teaching tips, take quizzes, work with a community, and earn credits in the Udemy course "VIP Linux"*

*You might learn some things merely by watching the videos, but you learn much more if you have Linux installed on your computer and participate*

*It is also very helpful if you know how to type correctly!*

That is the end of these instructions. You should feel like a better person.

# Oh, and have a cookie for finishing: ### #

## Installing Linux & Vrk
*Optional free tools: If you want your own Linux PC super media workstation...*
1. Install Ubuntu (alongside Windows, if you want) via [these fast instructions on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9NvmAitlwA&list=PLizgE6nGB1Kx8jIY1JE2v9rcL9G9s_UDj)
2. Install Vrk via the commands at [verb.ink](http://verb.ink)
3. Type with correct fingers. Learn here: [write.pink/88](http://write.pink/88)

## About Linux
The Linux command line only requires a bootable Linux USB, such as [Ubuntu via unetbootin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYfEs0lQA8Y&index=4&list=PLizgE6nGB1Kx8jIY1JE2v9rcL9G9s_UDj). It's the best place to begin to understand computer code—basic commands, if-do statements, variables, arrays, functions, and more. Learn it simple in Linux first.
