## Why learn Linux first?
*Renaissance: Learn the roots first, everything else makes more sense...*

### 1. Universal: web server, desktop, Android — All open source! All the same language!
Linux is the most-used webserver operating system in the world, with no near rivals. It's desktop market share grows every year!
Linux is free and secure, for web servers, desktops, and Android. The Linux language is the same everywhere.
Learn all devices; learn what is secure; learn what is free; learn only once!

### 2. Ultra Simple — Better preparation to learn other languages!
The Linux "Shell/BASH" language is simpler than other languages, but shares many universal concepts of code.
Learn computer code concepts the easy, simple way, using a simple, universal platform language.
By learning one "byte" at a time, you don't have to learn a difficult concept while learning a more complex coding language at the same time.

### 3. Ultimate Knowledge, Ultimate Control — PHP, Python, Pearl, Node.js, HTML, CSS... all sit atop Linux
It's one thing to learn a web app or server programming language; it's awesome to know the language under the language so you can *control the machine it runs on.*
PHP will make more sense if you have seen what this does: `sudo apt install php`
Once you know how to work with a computer terminal (Linux language), all code will be less scary because you'll know where code lives!

## Who should take this course?
- Everyone ages 7 through high school, as a general education course, home schooled or in the classroom

## Install the apps used in this course

`sudo apt install gedit tilda nautilus chromium-browser firefox`

## First day of school

*Many lessons begin with commands or helpful links, like this:*

`cd ~/School/VIP/101`

___

*There are twelve lessons per level, sometimes they are divided into sections with Roman numerals*

*Lessons are separated by **TOPIC**, NOT **TIME NEEDED TO COMPLETE**, so some may be longer than others*

*At the end of each lesson is a section called* **The Take** *which lists learning objectives for that lesson; this is useful information for students, teachers, crafting exams, or developing a curriculum core*

*Each lesson has a "homework" comparison folder that can be checked at* [inkVerb/VIP Homework](https://github.com/inkVerb/vip-homework/)

*There is a free video series that explains these lessons at the* [inkVerb YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCILld59lH8VOsT9gfyAb77g)

Udemy! *You can get more teaching tips, take quizzes, work with a community, and earn credits in the Udemy course "VIP Linux"* (NOT READY)

*You might learn some things merely by watching the videos, but you learn much more if you have Linux installed on your computer and follow as you learn*

*It is also very helpful if you know how to type correctly!* [write.pink/88](http://write.pink/88)

That is the end of these instructions. You should feel like a better person.
