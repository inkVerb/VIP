## Why learn Linux?
*Learn your roots first, then everything makes more sense.*
### 1. Universal: Linux web server, Linux desktop, Android, macOS, iOS — All the same language!
- Linux is the most-used webserver operating system in the world, with no near rivals. It's desktop market share grows every year!
- Linux is free and secure, for web servers, desktops, and Android. The Linux language is the same everywhere.
- macOS and iOS use Unix, the same language Linux was based on.
- Learn all devices; learn what is secure; learn what is free; learn only once!

### 2. Ultra Simple — Better preparation to learn other languages!
- The Linux "Shell/BASH" language is simpler than other languages, but shares many universal concepts of code.
- Units 501 & 701 explore other languages and concepts that run on Linux platforms

### 3. Ultimate Knowledge, Ultimate Control — PHP, Python, Go, Node.js, SQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JS... all sit atop Linux
- It's one thing to learn a web app or server programming language; it's awesome to know the language under the language so you can *control the machine it runs on.*
- PHP will make more sense if you have seen what this does: `sudo apt-get install php`
- Once you know how to work with a computer terminal (Linux/Unix language), all code will be less scary because you'll know where code lives!

## Who should take this course?
- Everyone ages 7 through high school, as a general education course, home schooled or in the classroom
- Any college student or graduate majoring in computer code, business, or anything else
- Anyone ages 13 or older interested in self-teaching to learn computers
- Any entrepreneur, project manager, copywriter, marketer, graphic designer, teacher, professor, life guard, dog catcher, firefighter, chef, union-card-carrying thespian, secretary, supervisor, executive, board member, politician, bureaucrat, dictator, monarch, Amway IBO, or anyone who WILL NOT learn computer code, but wants a peaceful and powerful relationship with a marketing firm, software writer, and/or IT staff—or just wants to be smarter than a smart phone
