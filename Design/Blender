#### Mouse
Scroll = zoom
Middle + Move = orbit
Shift + Middle + Move = pan
Ctrl + LeftClick = Circle select

Shift + Space / Ctrl + Up/Down = Max
Ctrl + Space = hide arrows
Alt + Space = Orientation

Select:
Ctrl + Tab / Ctrl + LeftClick + Drag
A = select all/none
B = border select
C = circle select

Q = Pi View Menu
Z = Pi Shade Menu (no Pi = wire frame / solid)
Tab = Pi Mode Menu (no Pi = Edit mode on/off)
N = Properties panel (set number values for object size/place, etc.)

Shift + A = add menu
Shift + S = snap menu
Shift + Z = quick render

X/Y/Z = axis (again for local)
Shift + X/Y/Z = plane (again for local)
G = Grab
S = Scale
R = Rotate

Ctrl + A = Apply menu (Apply the Location/Rotation/Scale changes BEFORE doing other operations such as Bevel)

Ctrl + Alt + Shift + C = Set Origin
- Origin to Geometry, etc

Shift + D = Duplicate
Alt + D = Duplicate as link
Ctrl + L = Link objects to last selected
Shift + L = Select Link menu
U = Unlink menu
L = make Local

## Edit Mode:
Ctrl + Tab = Mesh Select Mode (Vertex, Face, Edge)
E = extrude
P = sPlit to new object

**NOTE: Apply any scaling changes (Ctrl + A) BEFORE Bevel, otherwise bevel will be scaled as well.
Ctrl + R = add mid lines; Mouse Wheel > more
Ctrl + B = bevel edges; Mouse Wheel > more
Ctrl + Shift + B = bevel verticies; Mouse Wheel > more
Ctrl + E = Edges menu
Ctrl + RightClick = select range

Ctrl + Alt + RightClick = selecte entire UV loop
...changes with Vertex, Face, Edge Mesh Select Mode

Ctrl + R = loop cut (mouse wheel = add more)
> LeftClick, move = set place (+ Ctrl = snapping)
>> LeftClick = apply place
>> Esc = cancel place and use original

K = Knife tool
> LeftClick = drag/click to cut
> Enter/Space = apply cut
> Esc/RightClick = cancel cuts
> Ctrl = place cut at midpoint of affected lines
> Shift = allow cut point NOT on an edge
> E = start a new cut line
> C = 45° snapping
> Z = also cut all edges and surfaces behind view

### View
1 = front
2 = orbit back
3 = right side
4 = orbit left
5 = orthogonal/perspective toggle
6 = orbit right
7 = top
8 = orbit forward
9 = 
0 = camera view
1 + Ctrl = back
2 + Ctrl = pan down
3 + Ctrl = left side
4 + Ctrl = pan left
6 + Ctrl = pan right
7 + Ctrl = bottom
8 + Ctrl = pan up
9 + Ctrl =
0 + Ctrl = set active opject as camera
0 + Ctrl + Alt = set user view as camera
+ = zoom in
- = zoom out
/ = toggle local view
. = view selected

### Verticies
Ctrl + V

Add Modifier > Subdivision Surface (smooth via adding verticies)

Shift + D = duplicate
Ctrl + M = merg
Ctrl + J = join
Ctrl + Alt + Shift + C = origin to geometry

Shift + D = duplicate
Alt + D = linked duplicate
Ctrl + L = make links

#### Groups
Ctrl + G = new group
Ctrl + Alt + G = remove from groups
Ctrl + Ald + Shift + G = remobe from all groups
Ctrl + Shift + G = add selected to active group
Alt + Shift + G = remove selected to active group
Ctrl + 1 = subdivision
