# Moving On

## You're ready for more

After completing [Linux 101](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/101/README.md), [Linux 201](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/301/README.md), [Linux 301](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/301/README.md) & [Linux 401](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/401/README.md), other computer languages will be easier to understand.

- You already know why web languages and services will have settings in `/etc/...`.
- You already know that web programs will likely reside in `www/html/domain.tld/...` as text-editable files.
- You already know how to edit both on a desktop GUI editor and in the terminal via `vim` or `nano`.
- You already know how to navigate the terminal and perform basic operations on the web server that hosts your software.
- You already know how to follow tutorials online, recognizing `text styling for input code` and what that code probably does.
- You already know what "arguments", "variables", "functions", "include", "datatypes", and "logic tests" are when you see them in other languages.
- You already know how to create scripts and symlinks, manage permissions, and locate files as they relate to web server content and web apps.
- You already know the back-end of a desktop machine, if you are developing desktop software.
- You already have a deeper understanding of the machines used as platforms for most software.
- You know the back-end of one of the most stable, secure, and open source desktop platforms available, so you can lower your costs and help others do the same.

So, don't stop here. There's much more you can do. And, it's all much, much easier now to do. Keep moving and keep going!

## Web Stack: [Linux 501](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/501/README.md)

To gain a stronger understanding of web apps, which is where Linux is ***applied*** to daily life, take [Linux 501](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/501/README.md)

- This course is ***not*** for people fully trained in PHP web stack
  - But, it can be useful for:
    - Anyone self-taught who wants a more complete overview
    - Any beginner who wants to understand web app programming concepts for any language
- This course is a full ***overview*** of languages in a web stack
  - JavaScript/HTML/CSS
  - SQL
    - MySQLi
    - PDO
  - POST, GET, AJAX
  - XML
  - RSS & Podcast feeds
  - JavaScript libraries
    - TinyMCE WYSIWYG text editor
    - Dropzone drag-in file uploader
  - Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- The web stack uses PHP, but this performs many of the same tasks as [Go](https://go.dev), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and other web app languages
- Regardless of which web language you will use, PHP is a good intrduction to all of them
  - Many apps are written in PHP, so you will encounter PHP sooner or later
  - AJAX, POST, GET, and other tasks will be the same and are easily understood through PHP
- PHP is not the emphasis, but merely a means to understand web dev
  - This course demonstrates how any web app resides on a web server and can be changed on the server directly
  - The principles should be applied to other languages after this
  - Studying PHP "properly" will need more training after this
  - Training in PHP or any other server-side logic web language will be much easier after this course
- This gives a clear understanding of what a Linux server is used for
  - The next course for System Administrators, [Linux 601](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/601/README.md), seems more useful when you know how it is often used in the real world
- Any PHP or other web language training course will be much easier after taking this
- The [Linux 601: SysAdmin](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/601/README.md) course will seem more useful because [Linux 501: Web Stack](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/501/README.md) will give an understanding of what a Linux System Administrator is supporting for the real world

## System Administrator: [Linux 601](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/601/README.md)

You can skip [Linux 501](https://github.com/inkVerb/VIP/blob/master/501/README.md) and take this course directly, but it is not recommended unless you already have web programming training

- This course covers remaining topics for the Linux Foundation *Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)* exam, not yet covered in previous VIP courses
- This does not claim to be a comprehensive study guide, but approaches learning from the same organic, real-world approach
- This course is an in-depth ***preview*** of the topics covered in the *Linux Foundation System Administrator Essentials* course
  - All topics will be addressed, introduced, and explained
  - You may be able to pass the LFCS exam after taking this course alone, there is no guarantee, and the Linux Foundation courses are recommended
  - This course seeks to make that training faster and easier
  - This course seeks to boost LFCS exam scores and make the exam easier for those likely pass the exam anyway, but no guarantees
  - Success, improved scores with any exam, or ease with other training course are never guaranteed
