# Moving On

Now that you have completed this course, other computer languages will be easier to understand.

- You already know why web languages will have settings in `/etc/...`.
- You already know that web programs will likely reside in `/var/www/html/domain.tld/...` as text-editable files.
- You already know how to edit both on a desktop GUI editor and in the terminal via `vim` or `nano`.
- You already know how to navigate the terminal and perform basic operations on the web server that hosts your software.
- You already know how to follow tutorials online, recognizing `input code` and what that code probably does.
- You already know what "arguments", "variables", "functions", "include", "datatypes", and "logic tests" are when you see them in other languages.
- You already know how to create scripts and symlinks, manage permissions, and locate files as they relate to web server content and web apps.
- You already know the back-end of a desktop machine, if you are developing desktop software.
- You already have a deeper understanding of the machines used as platforms for most software.
- You know the back-end of one of the most stable, secure, and open source desktop platforms available, so you can lower your costs and help others do the same.

So, don't stop here. There's much more you can do. And, it's all much, much easier now to do. Keep moving and keep going!
